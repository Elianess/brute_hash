# brute_hash
brute force hash sha256 words consisting of five lowercase letters of the English alphabet with the ability to run search in single-threaded mode or in multi-threaded mode

## Task:
 - Password cryptographic strength checking software using brute force attack
### Brief description
- Find five-letter passwords with SHA-256 hash values using brute-force algorithm and display them on the screen.
- Hash values can be read from a file or directly from the console (hash value entry form)
- Your program must search all possible passwords consisting of only five lowercase letters of the English ASCII alphabet.
- The program must be able to run the search in single-threaded mode or in multi-threaded mode (The number of threads can be set by the user). For each mode it is necessary to display the time spent on the search.
